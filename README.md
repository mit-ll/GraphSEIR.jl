# GraphSEIR.jl

GraphSEIR is a network-based disease simulation model. This model takes as input a graph or network instance that captures contact patterns in a population. The model then uses an agent-based model called SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) that describes how disease spreads across this graph topology to produce simulated infection statistics.

This is a Julia package and requires a local installation of [Julia](https://julialang.org). Documentation for this tool can be found [here](https://mit-ll.github.io/GraphSEIR.jl/build/).

## Global Packages
GraphSEIR makes use of "Plots" and "PyPlot" - please add those to your default Julia environment via Pkg before importing GraphSEIR or running the scripts.

```
julia
]add Plots
]add PyPlot
```

## Installation

To install third-party dependencies and initialize the repository, from the root, simply do:
```
